        <strong><i style="font-size: 16px; color: darkgray;">hint: we are different, but in a really good way!</i></strong></p>
        <p>
            Our events are a little different that many other providers. We always run a maximum of 3 run groups (novice,
            intermediate, and advanced) and sometimes we run just 2 run groups (intermediate and advanced). We do this to maximize
            the amount of time that you spend on the track. Your time is valuable and the cost of the event is only a partial piece
            of the total cost. Use our track day calculator to try and determine what your cost per minute of track time is (include
            things such as hotel, gas to/from the event, food, vacation day, etc...). Ask other providers how much track time you
            get. We found events with more track time prevent anxious drivers and people stay more calm because they know they will
            always have more than enough track time.
        </p>

        <p>
            We also don't hide any event details or costs. There are no membership fees, no PayPal fees, no hidden fees. The price
            you see is the price you pay. Any of our costs are included in that fee. We also let you know how many spots in each run
            group have been taken, and provide details of your fellow drivers (if they allow it).so you can see what kind of cars
            will also be out there and if any of your friends are also attending the same event.
        </p>

        <p>
            We are also working on a referral program and loyalty program based on number of events attended yearly. We will provide
            more details once we get that in place, but you will save money per event if you attend multiple events. How much is
            still be decided.

            Got Track Days, Inc. is a new small business that was started to run events efficiently, at a fair price, and with
            consistency. We want to provide the same experience regardless of what event you attend with us, at any venue, and at a
            fair price. Some companies are run as hobbies, others are run so the organizers can get free days for themselves and
            their friends. Our company was created to run events, that is it. Not as a hobby, not to get free track days. We want to
            provide the best value in the industry (not the cheapest).

            The owner, Juan Calderon, started this company after attending events with multiple organizers over the last 8 years.
            There were things that he liked with every organizer, and many things that he did not. He talked with multiple attendees
            at many events to get feedback on what they liked about the events they were attending. Juan has a B.S. in Computer
            Science, and has been an IT developer for the last 10 years and disliked some of the manual processes that were in place
            with many organizers. He wanted to find ways to automate the registration process as well as providing transparency of
            events. He pursued an MBA and completed a business plan to get Got Track Days, Inc. off the ground. This idea has been
            in his head for over 16 years, but know he has the means to execute his dream.
